      <h2>Why Valorant??<h2>

      <p>Now coming to the thing that why should we will be playing VALORANT!! People who have interest in CSGO type of realistic PvP Games but also look to some unreality to discover, then this game is really made for them!! Also I have came to notice that some of the famous games these days are facing some issues. Thus, this game could be a win win for it's own. And it would be becoming a wanted game of the ERA, no doubt. Yet to survive the attack of time, or to face the long term progress, it still has to make immense progress, especially with it's Anti-Cheat-System and it's Characters!! <br><br>

      It's a Game, with some magical and unrealistic powers and has a true shooting experience!!</p>

  <h1>My Hand On And Observed Experience</h1>

  <p> Well, as you have noticed this game hasn't even being released still I have a page about this game and not about the ones which have been released. Honestly, I even don't have the experience with this game since it is still in it's beta version. But I have seen enough videos to love the game emmensely. I'm a die hard fan of CSGO, but i too liked the concepts of games having some magical and unrealistic/virtualistic powers. And thus, when this game was released and I came to know about that, I'm just craving for the launch date of the actual game, so I can play it!!</p>

<p>Word of Advice: Great game for computers with low specifications and for people looking for Real Shooter + Fun Unreality(if that's even a word) PvP Games!!</p>
