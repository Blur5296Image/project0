    <p class="intro">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. In competitive play, the game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists must either plant a bomb or kill the entire Counter-Terrorist team, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted by killing the entire Terrorist team or defusing the bomb.<br><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Major_Championships">Read more...</a></em></p>

      <h2>Why CSGO??<h2>

      <p>Well that's where the main question comes............Why CSGO?? According to my theory CSGO is a game for, yes beginners, but also it's for the Legends in the gaming World!! As far as my knowledge, no gamer criticizes this game. This is a low end game, and gives you great experience with shooting and PvP Modes. You can begin with it's offline version and can continue on Steam!! Although being too old, this game still win hearts, as it doesn't consumes much and fulfill it's basic promises. It has it's personal Valve-Anti-Cheat (VAC) Team to snitch out and ban the cheaters and has many dedicated servers around the Globe. <br><br>

      It's a Game, with no magical and unrealistic powers and is completely Down-To-Ground System!!</p>

  <h1>My Hand On And Observed Experience</h1>

  <p>I have played this series from Counter Strike: 2.0! And, as you would have guessed that this was the old version! So those Graphics were low back those days. And then came the next version as Counter Strike: Condition Zero, which somehow still rules many hearts!!  And then came this version, "CSGO". So obviously we were enlightened by these Graphics too, though I know they aren't a match to the next ones, yet the game has a special space in my hearts.</p>

<p>Word of Advice: Great game for computers with low specifications and for people looking for Real Shooter PVP Games!!</p>
