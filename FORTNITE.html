    <p class="intro">Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for all those platforms, and also for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android devices.<br><br>

    While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became a resounding success â€“ drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a cultural phenomenon.<br><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite">Read more...</a></em></p>

  <h1>My Hand On And Observed Experience</h1>

  <p>I have been playing this game for nearly one and a half year now, from Season 7. Fortnite never lets it's players down, and has always kept
them interested in the game by regular updates and several skins and new creativities. Also the communication of the developers with their users
is a key element in it's success. Although the ping and connectivity in India is too low, this game has really caught my heart, coz it is a next level,
or a next generation game if you prefer!! Now it has expanded to a comunity level!! Fortnite has holded virtualistic concerts and tournaments
and several other big events on different occassions, and thus, if you become a Fortnite Player, you're in a type of a community now, a Fortnite
community!!</p>

<p>Word of Advice: Really worth playing if you have a high end PC or an Xbox or a PlayStation(Personally I hate contoller players for their Aim Assist)!!</p>
